## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. ~~Install this mod from Nexus mods~~.
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

Note that the mod doesn't change store inventories, so you can only buy crop seeds during their
usual seasons.

## Configure
The mod creates a `config.json` file in its mod folder the first time you run it. You can open that
file in a text editor to configure the mod.

Here's what you can change:

setting              | default    | what it affects
:------------------- | :--------- | :------------------
`EnableInSeasons`    | all `true` | The seasons in which any crops should grow. Crops will revert to normal in disabled seasons.

## Compatibility
The mod is compatible with Stardew Valley 1.3+ on Linux/Mac/Windows, both single-player and
multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, it must be installed by the main player to work correctly.

* Inspired by [All Crops All Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/170),
  which I maintained for a long time after its author left. (This mod uses a very different
  approach under the hood though.)
